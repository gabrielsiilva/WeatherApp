## About this Project

A simple weather search app using the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather details and AsyncStorage in React Native to allow the user to save the desired information !!

## Why ?

This project is part of my personal portfolio, used to improve my skills in React Native.

## Some Observations about this App

I had some problems using this version of expo-cli on Android devices, but the errors will be fixed soon.

## Prerequisites

#### Install Node
Click in this link and install Node in LTS version: [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/);

#### Install Expo-CLI

If you're using  _**npm**_:

```
 $ npm install -g expo-cli

```

Or If you're using  _**yarn**_:

```
 $ yarn global add expo-cli
```

## Getting Started

**Cloning the Repository**

```
 $ git clone https://github.com/gabrielsiilva/WeatherApp.git

```

After cloning the repository you have to do the commands below:

```
 $ cd WeatherApp

```

And if you're using  _**yarn**_:

```
$ yarn

```

Or if you're using  _**npm**_:

```
$ npm install
```

### Running

To run the project make sure that you have the expo-cli in your computer, if you don't have the expo-cli, please read the section  [Prerequisites](https://github.com/gabrielsiilva/ReactNativeInstagramClone/tree/development#prerequisites)

You can check if you have the expo-cli just running this command below in your terminal:

```
 $ expo --version

```

If everything's okay and expo returns the version for you, just run this command bellow to start the project:

```
$ expo start

```

Or this command if you're using  _**npm**_:

```
$ npm start

```

Or if you're using  _**yarn**_:

```
$ yarn start

```

This will start a development server for you.
